# shazam

An implementation of Shazam in Python based off the [Shazam White Paper](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf).
To run this yourself create a `songs` directory, add songs in WAV format to it, and run `shazam.py` to build the database.
Then play one of those songs through your speakers and run `shazam.py` to identify the song.
